👋 Hi, I'm Vignesh, passionate about Web Development!

🚀 Tech Stack: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SQL, GraphQL.

🛠️ I've built scalable backends for GLB file storage and retrieval for configurator products. Also, check out my personal project, an Expense Tracker!

💡 I contributed to WebXR by suggesting a screenshot feature and providing a workaround for the current implementation.

🌟 Recognized as "Star of the Month" at my organization in June.

🔍 I thrive on the ever-evolving web development landscape and the constant need to stay up-to-date – it's a challenge I relish!
